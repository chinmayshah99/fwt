How to do The Name Game? - Learn the rules!

You can sing 'The Name Game' with (almost) every name. 
Sometimes it sounds better if you use a shorter nickname. (e.g. Mary for Marylin) 

The regular verse

Unless your name begins with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U), 'B', 'F' or 'M' you don't have to care about special rules. 
 The verse for the name 'Gary' would be like this: 

Gary, Gary, bo-bary 
 Banana-fana fo-fary 
 Fee-fi-mo-mary 
 Gary! 

At the end of every line, the name gets repeated without the first letter: Gary becomes ary 
 If we take (X) as the full name (Gary) and (Y) as the name without the first letter (ary) the verse would look like this: 

(X), (X), bo-b(Y) 
 Banana-fana fo-f(Y) 
 Fee-fi-mo-m(Y) 
 (X)! 

Vowel as first letter of the name

If you have a vowel as the first letter of your name (e.g. Earl) you do not truncate the name. 
 The verse looks like this: 

Earl, Earl, bo-bearl 
 Banana-fana fo-fearl 
 Fee-fi-mo-mearl 
 Earl! 

'B', 'F' or 'M' as first letter of the name

In case of a 'B', an 'F' or an 'M' (e.g. Billy, Felix, Mary) there is a special rule. 
The line which would 'rebuild' the name (e.g. bo-billy) is sang without the first letter of the name. 
The verse for the name Billy looks like this: 


Billy, Billy, bo-illy 
 Banana-fana fo-filly 
 Fee-fi-mo-milly 
 Billy! 

For the name 'Felix', this would be right: 

Felix, Felix, bo-belix 
 Banana-fana fo-elix 
 Fee-fi-mo-melix 
 Felix!
